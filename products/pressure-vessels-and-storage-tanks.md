Shridhan designs and manufactures pressure vessels and storage tanks to meet diverse industrial requirements, from concept through commissioning. With experience in ASME, IS, and other global design codes, these vessels are engineered for safe and reliable operation under extreme pressure and temperature conditions.
Shridhan's facilities support material handling up to 3 tons, with vessel sizes up to 2000 mm diameter x 5000 mm length. Vessels are designed for operational ranges from full vacuum to 350 kg/cm² pressure and -40°C to +450°C temperature.
All welding is carried out by ASME Section IX qualified welders, and supported by in-house Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) facilities for quality assurance.
