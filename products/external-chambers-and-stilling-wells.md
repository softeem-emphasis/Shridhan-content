Shridhan External Chambers allow level instruments to be mounted externally to process vessels. This provides isolation of instruments during maintenance while maintaining continuous plant operation.
Shridhan Stilling Wells are cylindrical cages installed inside tanks to dampen turbulence, reduce foaming, and provide a stable surface for accurate level measurement. Both external chambers and stilling wells are compatible with float and displacer switches, float-operated transmitters, and ultrasonic/radar sensors.
