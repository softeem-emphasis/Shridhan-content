  Custom-designed diaphragm seals for pressure, differential pressure, flow, and
  level transmitters, ensuring compatibility and reliable
  performance. 
  
  A diaphragm seal is a flexible membrane that
  seals and isolates an enclosure. The flexible nature of this seal allows
  pressure effects to cross the barrier but not the material being contained.
  Common uses for diaphragm seals are to protect pressure sensors from the
  process fluid whose pressure is being measured. A Diaphragm seal can be
  mounted to almost all pressure instruments. They are mostly used in
  combination with pressure (gauge or differential) transmitters, but also in
  combination with pressure gauges and pressure switches.

      Versatile flushing rings and flanges designed to maintain diaphragm seal
      cleanliness and process reliability.
    description: "Shridhan Flushing Rings and Flanges are installed between the flanged process connection and diaphragm seal. They allow flushing or venting of the area directly in front of the diaphragm to remove accumulated particles.\r\nThe two flushing ports enable cleaning, venting, or draining as required, ensuring the diaphragm seal remains free from buildup and ready for precise operation. Available in multiple nominal widths and forms, these accessories are adaptable to diverse process requirements."
