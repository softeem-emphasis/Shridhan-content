Shridhan Sight Flow Indicators provide a reliable way to observe flow conditions directly in industrial pipelines. They allow operators to visually confirm flow rate, direction, and liquid condition.
Depending on requirements, sight flows may include rotators for clear fluids, flappers for flow direction and intensity, or drip tubes for low-flow applications. Teflon-lined models are available for corrosive media.
