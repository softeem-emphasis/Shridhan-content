SHRIDHAN Magnetic level indicators (MLIs) are advanced instruments used for continuous liquid level measurement in tanks and vessels. They consist of a chamber mounted on the side of the vessel, containing a magnetic float that rises and falls with the liquid level. As the float moves, it interacts with an external indicator, typically a series of magnetic flaps or a magnetic bar graph, which provides a clear and precise visual indication of the liquid level.  
SHRIDHAN MLIs offer several advantages over traditional sight glasses. They are highly visible and can be read from a distance, even in low light or challenging environments. Because they are magnetically coupled, there is no direct contact between the indicator and the process fluid, ensuring a safer operation and reducing the risk of leaks or contamination.
