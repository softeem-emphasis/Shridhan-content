India Energy Week 2024 was inaugurated by our Honorable Prime Minister of India, Sri Narendra Modi. This event provided SHRIDHAN with a valuable platform to integrate the "Make in India" concept with leading giants in the O&G and petrochemical industries. It also offered significant opportunities to connect with all the PSU's where we are approved.
